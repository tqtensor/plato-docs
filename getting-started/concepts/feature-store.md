# Feature Store

A feature store is a centralized repository for storing, managing, and sharing features used in machine learning models. Features are input variables or characteristics used to train machine learning models, and a feature store makes it easier to manage these variables and improve the quality of the data.&#x20;

It provides a centralized location for storing, transforming, and sharing features, enabling data scientists to collaborate and reuse features more effectively. By improving the quality and consistency of features, a feature store can help organizations build better models and deploy them faster.
